# isfdb2-calibre

This is a reimplementation of the ISFDB Calibre plugin, optimised for cataloguing of physical collections of speculative fiction books. It is based on the [ISFDB Calibre plugin][1] written by Xtina Schelin, which I am maintaining in a [fork][2].

It currently doesn't exist. When it exists, it should have the following features:

* Fetching metadata from ISFDB, prioritising an ISFDB ID over other identifiers
* Ability to enter a list of ISFDB IDs and create new book records for all of them
* Ability to extract ISFDB IDs from the currently open tabs in a running Firefox session and create &c
