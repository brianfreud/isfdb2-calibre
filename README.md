# isfdb2-calibre

This is a reimplementation of the ISFDB Calibre plugin, optimised for cataloguing of physical collections of speculative fiction books. It is based on the [ISFDB Calibre plugin][1] written by Xtina Schelin, which I am maintaining in a [fork][2].

It currently doesn't exist. When it exists, it should have the following features:

* Fetching metadata from ISFDB, prioritising an ISFDB ID over other identifiers
* Ability to enter a list of ISFDB IDs and create new book records for all of them
* Ability to extract ISFDB IDs from the currently open tabs in a running Firefox session and create &c

This code is a work in progress, and is currently completely broken! In the meantime, please use the older fork. I may merge it back into the fork when it is done.

The messy manual process I currently use is documented [here](http://confluence.locustforge.net/blog/posts/isfdb-calibre/).
